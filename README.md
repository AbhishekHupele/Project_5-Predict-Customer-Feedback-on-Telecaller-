# Project_5-Predict-Customer-Feedback-on-Telecaller
The objective of this Case is to Predict the Feedback. Let’s assume it is Telecaller/Field Operative data for Customer Engagement for the purpose of

1. Maximising Sales/Revenue
2. Maximise customer touch point/increase brand awareness as a part marketing initiative/
hustle.
So, we are trying to get the FeedBack - Customer is Interested in purchase or sort of lead generation for

a) Conversion to Sales - if customer is positive to purchase 
b) Pursue further for Conversion - if customer is undecided

We also do the below tasks as part of DA-1 :—
1. Create the summary table (refer attachment sample_table_DA1.png) using the sample
dataset provided, programmatically. Clean the dataset if needed
2. Whether any inference could be reasoned out from the dataset.
3. Use any machine learning algorithm(s) to predict the Feedback. Reason out your choices.
